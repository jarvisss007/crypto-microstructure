# Lessons — the flow agent's self-calibration log

2026-07-15: File created. The agent appends dated, blunt takeaways here after
scoring its own direction calls in `ledger.csv`, and must re-read this file in
full before every brief. This is the SHARED brain — every agent or coach that
writes here signs its entries with a tag (`[flow]`, `[coach]`, ...).
Empty sections mean no scored history yet — earn the opinions.

## Standing priors (set at file creation, 2026-07-15)
- [flow] Default assumption: my direction calls are noise until the ledger
  proves otherwise. The project's own README predicts order-flow signals are
  arbitraged away before a retail feed sees them — a ~50% hit rate here would
  CONFIRM the house view, and that is a valid result.
- [flow] The `research/` backtest gate (IC, permutation p-value, cost-aware
  backtest) is the senior study. This ledger only probes the 1-day horizon;
  it never overrides a backtest_log.txt verdict.
- [flow] OFI call threshold is fixed at |OFI| >= 0.10. Changing it mid-stream
  is curve-fitting; any change gets recorded here as a signed decision.

## Scored-call takeaways
(none yet)

## Process lessons
(none yet)

## 2026-07-31 — first scored call
- [flow] 1/1 right (100%, n=1). BTC-USD `down` from OFI −0.17 on 2026-07-26;
  07-27 close 63694.43 vs 65347.92 call price. One call is NOTHING — n=1 is a
  coin that landed heads. No inference permitted, and the standing prior
  (calls are noise until proven otherwise) is untouched.
- [flow] Process failure worth recording: this row sat unscored for 4 days
  (2026-07-27 → 2026-07-31) because the sweep did not fire while the Mac slept,
  and no calls were logged 07-27 through 07-30 despite the collector recording
  every one of those sessions. Missed calls are missing data, not neutral —
  a ledger that only logs on days the laptop was awake is a biased sample.
- [flow] Today's logging convention, recorded so it is not silently changed:
  OFI is computed from the last COMPLETE UTC session (07-30), while
  `value_at_call` is the price at logging time from the in-progress file. Using
  the partial day's own close would leak 8 hours of already-known move into
  the call. Threshold stays fixed at |OFI| >= 0.10.

## 2026-08-03 — second scored call, and the coin landed tails
- [flow] 1/2 (50%, n=2). BTC-USD `up` from OFI +0.20 logged 07-31 at 63834.93;
  08-01 UTC close 62764.20 — lower, so WRONG. Exactly the shape the standing
  prior predicts: the flow-follows hypothesis is 1-for-1 in each direction and
  is currently a coin flip, which is what the project expects to find.
- [flow] Note the symmetry worth watching: the `down` call from OFI −0.17 was
  right and the `up` call from OFI +0.20 was wrong. If a directional asymmetry
  is real it will take dozens of calls to see; naming it now would be exactly
  the pattern-invention this ledger exists to catch. Recording it as a thing to
  check later, not as a finding.
- [flow] COLLECTOR OUTAGE: trade data stops at 2026-08-03 04:55 UTC and does
  not resume until 2026-08-04 03:18 UTC — a ~22.4-hour hole. Today's file is a
  16-minute stub (4,857 trades). Its OFI is +0.18, above the 0.10 threshold,
  and it was NOT used: the falsifiable unit is a session-wide imbalance, and
  16 minutes of tape dressed up as a session would be a fabricated call. The
  threshold stays fixed; the fix is the collector, not the rule.
- [flow] Last two COMPLETE sessions: 08-01 OFI −0.0706 (298,423 trades, full
  24h), 08-02 OFI −0.0660 (90,883 trades, 21.9h — truncated by the outage).
  Both below threshold, so no call today on the honest reading either.

## 2026-08-04 — nothing scored, collector partly recovered
- [flow] No rows came due (both ledger rows closed 08-01/07-27). Abstention
  logged against a named bar per the council rule: |OFI| on the last complete
  session is 0.024 versus the fixed 0.10 trigger. No call.
- [flow] The 08-03 outage flagged yesterday is now measurable in full. The
  `BTC-USD_2026-08-03.csv` session spans only 03:18-06:59 UTC on 08-04 —
  **3.7 of 24 hours, ~20.3h lost**. The collector has since recovered (08-04 is
  writing normally, ~20.8h and 90,619 trades so far), so this is a bounded
  outage rather than a dead recorder. Per the council's flag-don't-work-around
  rule, the 08-03 session is recorded as unusable and is not being treated as a
  session-wide imbalance no matter what its OFI reads.
- [flow] Sign instability worth noting only as noise: 08-03 reads -0.024 and
  the in-progress 08-04 reads +0.061. Two sub-threshold numbers flipping sign
  is what no-signal looks like; it is not a turn in flow and is not being
  narrated as one.
- [flow] Today's auto-backtest keeps reproducing the null cleanly, and the
  detail is worth carrying: `book_imb` has a genuinely *significant*
  association (IC 0.191 at 5s, p=0.002) and it is still net ~-60 bps, because
  gross is ~0.08 bps against 60 bps of cost. That is the single best
  illustration this lab has of why statistical significance and edge are
  different things. A signal can be real and worthless at the same time.

2026-08-05 [flow] — Nothing scored (ledger 0 pending; forecasts check 08-06 and 08-08).
Abstention logged against the named 0.10 OFI bar: last COMPLETE session (08-04) OFI
+0.0644, below threshold, no call.

RECORDING THE TEMPTATION, BECAUSE IT WAS REAL. Two OFI numbers were available this run:
the complete 08-04 session at +0.0644 (no call) and the in-progress 08-05 session at
+0.1217 (clears the bar). Choosing the second would have been threshold-fishing by the
back door — not tuning the 0.10 number, which AGENT.md explicitly forbids, but quietly
changing the WINDOW the number is computed over until one of them crosses. Same violation,
harder to spot in a diff. Rule for future runs: the window is the last COMPLETE session,
full stop, and if two candidate windows disagree that fact goes in the brief rather than
being resolved in favour of a call.

FOUND A MISALIGNMENT IN THE FALSIFIABLE UNIT ITSELF. `BTC-USD_2026-08-04.csv` spans
07:00 UTC to 06:59 UTC the next day. The collector names files by LOCAL date
(research/collector.py `_ensure_file`, timestamps from `time.time()`), so a "session" file
is a PDT day. But AGENT.md specifies UTC calendar days for date math, and step 2 scores
against Coinbase UTC daily candles. So the OFI window is offset ~7 hours from the return
window it is supposed to predict: roughly a third of the flow being measured happens
during the return period rather than before it. At n=2 this has not cost anything yet, but
it is a lookahead leak baked into the unit, and it would flatter the flow-follows
hypothesis rather than hurt it. Needs an `[anupam]`/`[coach]` decision — either the
collector rolls files at UTC midnight, or scoring uses PDT-day returns. Do not paper over
it by continuing to log calls as if the windows lined up.

Third, on forecast design: the previous two forecast rows both used a completed daily
close as reference and were written mid-session, which imports a few hours of known tape.
Today's row is framed as "08-06 UTC close above 08-05 UTC close" — both endpoints unknown
at write time — so it is uncontaminated, and it happens to test the ledger's actual 1-day
flow-follows hypothesis rather than a drift prior. Cheap fix, worth keeping.

Unchanged and worth restating: the hourly honest gate re-ran at 08:15 with 145,237 trades
and again returned no net-positive signal at any horizon after 60bps, with real
associations (ofi IC 0.089 at 5s, p=0.002) that die entirely on costs. Association is not
edge. This ledger tests only whether anything survives to a 1-day horizon; it does not get
to overrule that.

2026-08-06 [flow] — Nothing scored. Both existing ledger rows closed long ago (1/2, and
n=2 is not a hit rate). One new call logged: the 08-05 session OFI came in at +0.1247,
which clears the 0.10 trigger, so `up` on BTC-USD, value_at_call 64,796.79, checks 08-07.
The threshold fired mechanically and I did not touch it.

Two findings, and the first one is a defect in this lab's own falsifiable unit.

(1) THE SESSION FILES ARE NOT UTC DAYS, AND THE LEDGER SCORES THEM AS IF THEY WERE.
Checked the timestamps directly instead of trusting the filename: every
`BTC-USD_<date>.csv` spans **07:00 UTC → 06:59 UTC the next day**. That is a local
midnight-to-midnight PDT day, not a UTC day. AGENT.md then says `value_at_call` = the last
trade price in that CSV — a **06:59 UTC** print — while step 2 scores `value_at_check`
off Coinbase's **UTC daily candle**, which closes at 00:00 UTC. So every row in this ledger
compares a price taken at 06:59 UTC against a close taken at 00:00 UTC: a seven-hour
mismatch baked into the unit. On a 1-day direction call, seven hours is not a rounding
error. Both prior rows (07-26 right, 07-31 wrong) carry it. I logged today's row to the
existing spec anyway rather than silently redefining the unit mid-stream — per AGENT.md,
a rule change is a [coach]/Anupam decision. Flagging it for that decision. The clean fix is
to take `value_at_call` from the same Coinbase daily-candle series used for scoring, so
both endpoints come from one clock.

(2) DID NOT RESOLVE TWO DUE FORECASTS, ON PURPOSE. The 08-03 and 08-05 rows both check
2026-08-06 and both need the **08-06 UTC daily close**. This run fired at 15:33 UTC — the
UTC day has ~8.5 hours left. Coinbase does return an 08-06 candle, and its `close` field
reads 64,782.39, which is exactly the trap: volume on that candle is 2,948.8 against
6,227-7,086 on the last four complete days, so the field is a live price wearing a close's
name. Marking those rows 1/0 off it would have been the same class of error the council
has now logged three times on this desk. Both rows carry a dated deferral note and resolve
on the next run off the completed candle. Nothing is lost; the alternative was a fabricated
observation in the only record this lab is graded on.

Senior study unchanged, and it re-ran today at 08:11 on 35,556 trades: **no signal is
net-positive after costs at any horizon**. Best net was -59.83 bps at 60s. OFI's IC decays
from 0.066 at 5s to 0.008 (p=0.176, not significant) at 60s — the association is real and
gone within a minute, which is the README's expectation stated in numbers. The 1-day
ledger is testing a different horizon and must never be read as contradicting that.
